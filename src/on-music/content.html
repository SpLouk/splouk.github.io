<p>It’s all folk music now</p>
<p>
  The importance of musical movements and the innovation of new genres has been
  declining for some time now. I know that people have been saying this forever.
  I also realize that, at 26, I’m the prime age to join the “music is dead”
  camp; the bands I loved as a teenager are old now. But, in my mind at least,
  it’s not that I’m disappointed by the new styles of music coming out; I’m not
  even claiming that new music is particularly bad. I’m really asking:
  <em>where is the new music?</em> Not that there aren’t a billion songs being
  made every second, but where are the new styles? Where are the sounds that
  will define the early 2020s in popular culture? Listen to the first 30 seconds
  of this song:

  Someone who is familiar with popular music of the last 50 years or so will
  probably be able to place this song in a timeline of musical movements with a
  decent amount of accuracy – i.e. they would be able to guess that the song was
  released in the 1980s. Will we be able to identify 2020s music the same way?
</p>
<h1 class="section-title">Some Armchair History</h1>
<p>
  Here’s my extremely reductive layman’s theory of modern music: movements in
  popular music have been mostly spurred by technological and social change.
  Invention of instruments like the piano, the saxophone, and later the electric
  guitar and synthesizer pushed music forward and allowed the creation of new
  genres. The invention of these instruments created completely new sonic
  frontiers; musical landscapes which literally could not have been explored
  before. Before the synth was created <em>– less than 100 years ago –</em>
  synthy sounds had never existed for the entirety of human history. Of course,
  we are used to the miracles our age.
</p>
<p>
  The 20th century was a hot time for innovation and social upheaval (probably
  not a coincidence). Capitalism and industrialization acted like a pair of
  bellows, heating society up into a more malleable and energetic state. In the
  US, new instruments like the electric guitar went with new social attitudes
  like lightning and thunder. We got jazz and rock and roll out of this. Then we
  got a whole bunch of other genres. New technology and artistic experimentation
  were supercharged by the financial incentive to create music created by the
  ability to record and sell records on vinyl. The result was an exponential
  explosion. The rate of change and diversification accelerated: it was much
  faster in the 1970s than in the 1930s. There were simply more people trying to
  make it in the music industry.
</p>
<p>
  Music genres became attached to (and spawned) social scenes. These social
  scenes were an extremely important part of teenagers’ identities in the late
  20th C. In the 1950s, youth culture itself was a novelty; the idea that
  teenagers represented their own identity and demographic – with their own
  preferences for music and movies – was new. The 1950s youth culture of Elvis,
  Buddy Holly and early rock-n-roll fragmented into a million subcultures: surf
  rock, psychedelic rock, hard rock, punk, heavy metal, disco, whatever the
  Talking Heads were, etc. There were movements and countermovements. People
  used to dress like the bands they listened to, form their politics, and hang
  out with other people based on music taste! That’s mostly over now. Most
  people my age and younger listen to “a bit of everything”. Music discovery
  happens through Spotify playlists and Tik Tok, where specific artists have
  become commoditized, accessed through playlists or videos seeking a certain
  sonic mood. None of this means that music is any less enjoyable to listen to,
  of course. For those of us who love music, it’s more accessible than ever.
  It’s just not socially or politically important. Again, this is a long-term
  trend, something that I’m sure began even before Limewire and Napster.
</p>
<h1 class="section-title">The End of Music</h1>
<p>
  I want to be bold here and claim that music innovation has basically run it’s
  course, at least for now. Let me explain.
</p>
<p>
  I’ve described how music innovation has generally happened along two axes:
  technological and social innovation. Barring some kind of miracle, I think I
  can confidently say that we’ve reached the end of technological innovation for
  sound creation. Modern synthesizers can create any tone or sound at high
  fidelity. Sure, new organic instruments could be created, but I think it would
  be hard to create something that is both (a) radically different than what
  already exists and (b) sounds pleasant. Artists have been experimenting with
  sound for a century now (actually since the beginning of time, but in the
  context of the modern music industry). Bryan Wilson was using bike horns and
  coke cans in Pet Sounds in the 1960s. The Beatles famously experimented with
  the sitar. I’m happy to be proven wrong, but I just don’t think that there are
  whole <em>new sounds</em> to be discovered; micro-innovations sure, but we’re
  never getting a new electric guitar.
</p>
<p>
  That leaves social change. I think it’s hard sometimes to understand just how
  different the past was from today. Before teen culture came into existence in
  the post-WW2 years in the USA, music was not an identity for young people. The
  massive social change in the 50s and 60s ushered in the modern era of popular
  music, and the establishment of music as a foundation of identity for young
  people. The type of music that becomes popular acts as a mirror held up to our
  collective consciousness. The post-WW2 shift of our social priorities towards
  individualism, sexual freedom, and the pursuit of self-actualization shows up
  in rock n’ roll, and the popular music that came after it. If the rock n’ roll
  revolution was a break from what came before it, a rebellion, then the decades
  that have followed have been iterations on the same ideas, even as genres
  devour one another and fashions change like the wind. Until our culture
  experiences another “break” – a social paradigm shift – I don’t think we will
  see radical new ideas in lyrical themes or song structures (in pop music).
</p>
<p>
  Now, this is all just my crackpot speculating. To be honest I never thought
  too much about this stuff before. I don’t worry about where my music comes
  from, I just <em>consume</em>. But when I go out now, the music is a
  hodgepodge of popular music from the last 20 years. What are the kids
  listening to these days? The silence is deafening. Commercially,

    >old music now outsells new music</a
  >. Personally, I can’t name any important developments or new styles of music
  from the last couple of years. The most recent I can think of is the
  late-2010s mumble rap &amp; trap wave. But why speculate? After all, we have
  data on our side. Take a look at this list of the
  <a href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/hot-100-songs/"
    >top songs of 2021</a
  >. I’ve added the musical styles that I can detect as major influences on each
  song.

  Six out of eight of the most popular songs of 2021 had major influences from
  legacy music genres!
</p>
<p>
  Ok, ok, I understand that the pop charts aren’t exactly the best place to find
  the cutting edge of music. The pop charts are not for music lovers; they’re
  for dentist’s offices and college move-in days. There are still many, many
  people who love music. What are they listening to?
</p>
<p>
  I’ve been listening to a brand called Drugdealer lately. I had it recommended
  to me by a friend who loves music, then again by another friend who loves
  music. I finally gave them a chance, and I like them a lot. I’ve been
  listening to their new album on repeat. But here’s the thing: their music
  wouldn’t be out of place in the 1970s. In fact, it would be impossible for
  almost anyone to listen to this band and not think something like “This band
  has a 70s sound.” Now, Drugdealer writes original songs, but sonically they
  fit squarely in a musical movement that came and went a long time ago. I find
  that a lot of the new music I enjoy is like this: new, but old.
</p>
<h1 class="section-title">What's Old is New</h1>
<p>
  Before the industrial revolution, before capitalism kick-started an insatiable
  incentive system for innovating new sounds in music (and recording those
  sounds, and the creation of “intellectual property”), music looked a lot
  different. You might say that where music creation looked most similar to
  today was in the upper-class of Western society. There, classical music was
  composed by writers who were well known and paid for their work. Music was
  written in notation, allowing it to persist relatively unchanged (though until
  recording was invented it still needed musicians to be heard). Classic music
  composition followed movements; composers were influenced by the composers who
  came before them. They studied their work, improved on it, or rejected it and
  created something new.
</p>
<p>
  For the vast majority of people, in the West and elsewhere, this was not the
  case. Music was passed down in living rooms, bars, at funerals and in
  battlefields. Music, what we now call folk music, belonged to cultures, not
  individuals, not specific generations. Sounds were passed on and persisted for
  a long time. They changed too, through evolution. Each musician leaves a
  fingerprint on what they play. But innovation and artistic differentiation
  played second fiddle to familiarity. What was appealing was more important
  than what was new.
</p>
<p>
  We’ve gotten used to a state of affairs that is in actuality an aberration in
  the larger context of music history. The past 100 or so years have seen an
  exponential growth in music recording, innovation, technology and development.
  We’ve come to accept this as completely normal, but maybe we’re now in the
  twilight of a completely exceptional era of human history. What’s old is new.
  We are going back to the days of folk music. Not that everyone is going to
  pick up acoustic instruments again (though
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eokqh2NXqIw"
    >we did that in the 2010s</a
  >), but in the broader sense of the word meaning <em>music from tradition</em>
</p>
<p>
  Of course, much has changed. The mountain of music recorded by our ancestors
  still exists. It’s likely that people will still listen to the Beatles (and
  maybe even Blink 182) in 100, 200 years. Our great-great grandchildren will
  have a favourite album of the 1970s, just like myself and people my age. New
  music will be recorded, but popular taste will put less emphasis on what is
  new and instead refocus on simply <em>what sounds nice.</em>
</p>
<p>
  Is this a bad thing? I don’t know. The human art form called music blossomed
  in an unexpected and beautiful way in the last century. The products of this –
  the recordings and the musical styles – are precious to me, personally, and
  billions of other people. To imagine a future where this time period is seen
  as a kind of “renaissance” era that came and went in a few generations is sad
  to me in some way. Still, I welcome the “folkification” of music. I want to
  enjoy music simply for the joy it gives me, rather than being concerned about
  listening to the <em>right genres</em> and the <em>right artists</em>. When
  all the hype is over, when the glamour and lifestyle is stripped away, what
  we’re left with is what we really came for anyways.
</p>
<h1 class="section-title">P.S.</h1>
<p>
  The fate that's come for the music industry is nothing new either, after all.
  It has quietly happened to every individual music scene whose moment in the
  spotlight is over. Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits understood this. In the 70s
  he walked into a bar in south London and heard a band playing swing music. The
  place wasn't crowded; most people there weren't even paying attention. The
  players worked day jobs. You've probably been in a scene like that before.
  It's not too surprising; swing was popular in the 30s, by the 70s it wasn't
  cool anymore. Mark wrote a song about that experience, one of my favourites
  ever, "Sultans of Swing". It's an ode, not to famous artists or rock stars,
  but to masters nonetheless.
