      <h1>What I have learned about making sourdough (so far)</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">July 4, 2022</p>
      <p>
        I began making sourdough in February of this year. At first, I tried to
        loosely follow some Youtube guides that I came across, but I found that
        the results were inconsistent and often inedible. This is how some of
        the early loaves I made looked:

        There were more loaves that were somewhere between the two above in
        terms of quality. Now, making a loaf of sourdough bread is typically a
        full day’s effort (I’ve figured out ways to make the process more
        flexible for a busy schedule, which I’ll discuss more later), so getting
        a mediocre result after a full day’s work is pretty discouraging, never
        mind when the whole loaf needs to be tossed! This would not do, so I
        decided to get serious about making sourdough.

          I downloaded an e-book copy of
          <a
            href="https://www.google.ca/books/edition/Tartine_Bread/JS_UAAAAQBAJ"
            >Tartine Bread</a
          >
          by Chad Robertson, which contains a step-by-step recipe for what he
          calls “the country loaf”, i.e. a basic sourdough. Following this guide
          closely transformed my results instantly; now I was consistently
          getting light, fluffy, moist, delicious sourdough bread. I will take
          the chance to brag a bit here and say that I now prefer my own bread
          to almost any that I have bought in a bakery. Since I began using this
          book to bake bread, I have learned a couple of things about making
          sourdough through experimentation and note-taking. I will talk about
          some of these findings, but first I would like to elaborate on my
          note-taking process, and how it has helped me.

        Make bread; take notes; make break again, reviewing your notes from last
        time, take notes again; repeat. The first variable that I started
        playing around with once I was consistently producing edible loaves is
        <em>hydration</em>. Hydration refers to the water that a loaf contains,
        by weight, as a percentage of the weight of the flour used. For example,
        if I used 1000g of flour and 800g water, then I have an 80% hydration
        loaf. I had read that higher hydration loaves are a mark of artisanal
        bread, because working wet dough is challenging. When I started to boost
        my hydration to 80, 85, then 90%, I found that I loved the moist, spongy
        result. However, I also began to find that my loaves did not have the
        same “oven spring” (rise) and instead tended to be flatter and wider,
        losing their structure in the baking process. After doing some googling,
        I found out that higher-hydration loaves will not rise as much. Looking
        back through my notes, I was able to see the progression of how my
        loaves rose less the more hydration I used. I’ve now settled in the
        75%-80% range, and am back to getting nicely structured loaves.

        The other tool that has allowed me to get consistently good bread is the
        humble checklist. I have learned to
        <strong
          >use checklists for jobs that follow a process, even if you don’t
          think you need to</strong
        >. Checklists simply guard against forgetfulness, something I am often
        victim to. I use the same checklist for each loaf I make (I use a
        <a href="https://notion.so">Notion.so</a> template for my bread notes,
        so the checklist is right there at the top always). Before I started
        using checklists, I forgot to add salt to one of my loaves, and burned
        another by using the wrong oven temperature. These kinds of mistakes
        haven’t happened since I adopted the checklist.
      </p>
      <p>
        I still mostly follow the Tartine country bread recipe, which makes two
        loaves at a time. Instead of baking the loaves serially, I bake both at
        once because I happen to have two dutch ovens. Another modification I
        have made is that I leave the dough in the same container for the
        entirety of the fermentation process, which saves me a dish. Some key
        things I really like about the Tartine process:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          stretch-and-folding the dough inside its container during the
          fermentation process saves a ton of mess and hassle, compared to
          dumping it on the counter to knead
        </li>
        <li>
          making two loaves at once makes the whole process feel a lot more
          worthwhile
        </li>
        <li>it’s a very simple recipe that makes great bread</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Tartine bread process is actually not a ton of work. From start to
        finish, it’s probably an hour or so of actual hands-on time. However,
        that labour is spread out over a ~24 hour period. The typical
        breadmaking schedule I have followed is something like this:
      </p>
      <p>12:00PM day 1 - mix flour/water/starter</p>
      <p>
        12:45PM - add salt, ferment all afternoon; stretch-and-fold ever
        half-hour or so
      </p>
      <p>5PM - shape loaves</p>
      <p>6PM - begin final proofing in fridge</p>
      <p>8AM day 2 - bake</p>
      <p>
        So while there isn’t a ton of actual labour, this is still a
        time-consuming process. In the days of WFH it was kind of nice to get up
        from my computer every half-hour to turn dough, but once I started
        working in the office again this wasn’t possible. Sourdough making
        became a weekend-only activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking to make the process more flexible, I began experimenting with
        doing the fermentation step in the fridge. The idea behind this is to
        stretch the fermentation out from taking ~4 hours at 25degC to taking a
        day or two in the fridge. Then, if I want to make a loaf, I can start it
        if I have an hour free on a weeknight, set it in the fridge to ferment,
        and shape it the next evening or the evening after. All I have to do is
        stretch-and-fold it every so often when I’m already in the kitchen. This
        has worked out pretty well so far. The longer fermentation results in
        more complex (and slightly sourer) bread flavours, but the effect is
        small and I actually like the taste better. A “fridge rise” schedule
        might look like this:
      </p>
      <p>6PM day 1 - mix flour/water/starter</p>
      <p>6:45PM - add salt; place in fridge for fermentation</p>
      <p>day 2 - stretch and fold as convenient</p>
      <p>6PM day 3 - shape loaves</p>
      <p>7PM day 3 - begin final proofing in fridge</p>
      <p>8AM day 4 - bake</p>
      <p>
        The time between adding salt and shaping the loaves is fairly flexible,
        and could probably be between 1-2.5 days (I haven’t experimented enough
        with this method yet to know an exact range), meaning that this method
        can easily be integrated with a busy schedule.
      </p>

        My last learning so far:
        <strong>making your own bread is 100% worth it.</strong> Honestly, while
        I like the process, the majority of the reason why I have kept up
        consistently making bread is just how delicious the result is.
        Plastic-bag bread is ruined for me forever, and I don’t live very close
        to a good bakery. I’m trapped in a vicious cycle of baking and eating
        delicious bread and I can’t get out!
