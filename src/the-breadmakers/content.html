<p class="first-paragraph">
  I was biking home from work on one of those days of summer when it’s not too
  humid outside and I can expect to arrive at my office without getting sweaty.
  I was nearly home, and since I can hop into the shower as soon as I get there
  I like to push it a bit harder when heading that way. Cassie had asked me to
  grab a couple of things from the store. Butter, some salad greens, mustard.
  She was baking at home; it was her dinner night. Sausages, salad, fresh bread;
  I was hungry. I dodged through an intersection after a quick glance to each
  side, ignoring the stop sign. Iowa stop. I looked up at the shady green street
  ahead of me, panting, working the pedals like a steam engine. Then something
  unexpected happened. I don't know exactly what, really. I was here and then I
  wasn't. Well, I was riding my bike and then I wasn't riding my bike, home from
  the store, my groceries in my pannier bags. But then I didn't have groceries
  or panniers, and I was on my feet in an empty room. That’s the only way I can
  really describe it. I was riding my bike, and then I was standing in this
  room; dimly lit, appearing to be a perfect cube, with a kind of grey
  cement-like interior. As my eyes adjusted to the light, I noticed a figure
  standing in front of me, humanoid. It was exactly my height, of this I'm quite
  confident, and it was grey, appearing to be made of the same cement as the
  walls. The jolt of my apparent teleportation had me in a decidedly
  uncomfortable state. I did not know at this point that I had been abducted by
  aliens. I figured that out later.
</p>
<p id="f724d807-1151-4e3b-a583-8f092a08b28e" class="">
  The stone statue seemed to gaze at me under its prominent singular brow,
  though I could not discern actual eyes under the shadow. Its head resembled
  one those heads from Easter Island; those massive stone faces with large
  brows, long sloping noses, and pouty lips. For a few moments we stared at each
  other and only my ragged breath could be heard, escaping from between my lips,
  absorbed by the walls. I did not think to move. Then it spoke, with a calm and
  measured voice that was not altogether alien; a sort of gender-neutral
  announcer voice: "Hello" it said, though its lips did not move. It said this
  as if beginning a service announcement, like its next words would be "–please
  don't forget your bags as you depart the train." But there was a hint of
  solidity in the voice also – something formidable beneath its placid surface.
</p>
<p id="cd708186-e758-4bce-af43-53c68ee8c788" class="">
  Now after a minute or so of staring in complete silence at this man-shaped
  thing, the initial shock of my teleportation was wearing off and replacing
  itself with a rising panic and disorientation. I tried to speak, but was only
  successful at moving my mouth into a kind of gape. Then the announcer voice
  again said: "Hello. Please don't panic, you aren't in any immediate danger."
  While hearing this from this man did not inspire me with a significant amount
  of increased assuredness, I was able to – maybe in partial credit to that
  soothing tone – regain my composure enough to say a word. That word sounded
  something like "Eeeugghwhaaa–?" which is almost certainly not the finest word
  ever crafted by a man but would have to suffice as the first one gasped by one
  man to an intelligent life not of his own species.
</p>
<p id="14a12797-f83a-42d3-8c23-7cba9d342491" class="">
  Though really I did not yet grasp this. If I had to say what my impression was
  of this creature at the time, I would have told you that I thought I was
  speaking to a man in costume. Again, this thing was exactly my height, with a
  completely nondescript smooth grey body; and when I say that it looked like an
  Easter Island statue, I really mean that it looked like if you took one of
  those big stone heads, shrunk it down to human size, and put it right on top
  of a body that was an equivalently abstract human representation. I saw no
  fingers or toes at the ends of its limbs. Shape-wise, it was like the creature
  had booties and mitts on, except that there was no seam or discontinuity at
  the wrists and ankles; no genitals, no belly button; just smooth grey skin,
  like an unkilned clay statue.
</p>
<p id="7a94d7b9-b340-4bb3-a7f9-bbfe26c4123c" class="">
  At this point, my throat unclenched enough that I could manage a few words, so
  I asked the only question that someone in my situation should:
</p>
<p id="638e8667-a0e1-446b-a589-7519751912c8" class="">
  "What… the fuck?" Again, not the best introductory words in the first
  inter-species conversation, but I did not understand myself as a diplomat for
  all humanity. In fact, I felt rather more like a beetle turned on its back,
  flailing. It spoke.
</p>
<p id="d7f51c88-992d-4e7a-a4d9-20530e5a91a3" class="">
  "Don't worry, I can and will answer your questions." Said my easter island
  head. And continued: "How are you feeling?"
</p>
<p id="3d20ce1e-ba26-4b96-b52a-d5009f0ad24e" class="">
  How was I feeling? The question felt strangely abstract in the moment. I?
  Feeling? My cortisol-addled mind fumbled for self-concept, and attempted but
  failed to compile the cocktail of signals bouncing through its electric
  hallways into a descriptive word. My neurons scattered like cockroaches, each
  unable to bear the load being asked of it.
</p>
<p id="10db7c2b-9b65-4d24-a1e6-3e3b5a21678e" class="">
  "How the hell do you think?" I managed, deflecting.
</p>
<p id="ef6689b0-bffd-45e5-afd0-abd8d322d0cf" class="">
  "Fair enough.", the being acknowledged, "In a purely physical sense, do you
  feel healthy?"
</p>
<p id="9a546fd7-7ecf-4260-a446-fdbf104f5d4e" class="">
  I assessed my beating heart, the sweat dripping from my palms, and the dryness
  of my mouth. "Sure" I fibbed. “Who the fuck are you?”
</p>
<p id="3fbe1fb5-6433-4aeb-80a3-cef0fc32f21d" class="">
  "Glad to hear it.” It replied, ignoring my question. “You look… vital. Now, I
  understand that you are undoubtedly bewildered. I would like to let you know
  that you need not worry. You have been raptured."
</p>
<p id="6d949d87-f348-4aa3-b9a9-023508ee76cc" class="">
  I could not immediately respond. It waited.
</p>
<p id="aae7a6a7-568f-4cfc-9792-2fbac1b5d148" class="">
  "Raptured?" I repeated after a time, confused.
</p>
<p id="fe7bfdb3-1cdc-4921-93a4-9dead4cab951" class="">
  "Raptured, yes. I believe that is the correct English word. You have been
  chosen."
</p>
<p id="1b7f45ea-1829-434f-aff0-407bb7d1ef6c" class="">
  I thought about that one for a minute. It gave me pause, because up until this
  point I hadn't constructed anything with what my senses were feeding me; no
  higher-order analysis of what might be going on. I considered the being before
  me again and realized that I no longer interpreted it to be a man in a
  costume. It was not quite believable. The body looked almost decorative; it
  was too slender for the large, heavy looking head. This thing, what is this
  thing?
</p>
<p id="36e81d38-d3fe-4039-aefc-6ce748a01d76" class="">
  "Who are you?" I blurted, reasserting my demand.
</p>
<p id="6cff006f-c884-4f5e-a2d0-c05d2e308ca2" class="">
  This time there was no immediate reaction from the face of this stone man. I
  could not imagine what it would look like for it to take any expression but
  the stern, stoic face it had worn up until this point.
</p>
<p id="e5a85fa1-f326-4b35-a650-2014b7fd41b9" class="">
  "I am a sort of representative" it spoke after a minute. "Or perhaps I could
  be better understood as an interface. I am a simplification; something that
  you can see and understand to make this process smoother. Humans respond
  better to a familiar figure."
</p>
<p id="2cd9cb83-5d2e-455f-bd37-3926375b1b61" class="">
  It didn’t look too familiar to me, and I sure as hell didn’t understand. An
  interface?
</p>
<p id="f4f6c684-68cb-4e66-81b8-db81be19931f" class="">
  "You represent God?" I asked.
</p>
<p id="bed3bae8-12c9-47c4-8ea9-de57b5f29b2b" class="">
  “God?” It responded. I was fairly sure I heard the intonation of a question.
</p>
<p id="c3802625-4416-4471-bee5-d229bc1e01f2" class="">
  “Rapture. You said I’m being raptured.”
</p>

  It did not respond immediately.
</p>
<p id="0cc9a0b1-afc6-47b3-9cb4-800eabf24a8f" class="">
  "I represent what you might understand as gods in the classical Greek sense. I

  concept, but I think it is apt."

<p id="40cff994-87eb-4f88-baf0-23873fb4fbaf" class="">
  "So I've ascended to heaven? The world is ending? I don't see clouds and
  pearly gates."
</p>
<p id="3d886434-4011-49ce-a84d-f07c51d5d51d" class="">
  I was regaining my ability to speak properly, and some confidence in my
  diaphragm to take breaths without them sounding like ragged gasps.
</p>
<p id="bf1409fa-fce1-4424-a5f7-e5d0346785cb" class="">
  "The world that you know is ending indeed. But no, you are not ascending to

<p id="517a8923-cb99-432f-b6df-e2d19d86f998" class="">
  This revelation did not bring me much closer to understanding what was going
  on. But I began to think about the words that this interface man was telling
  me. The world that you know is ending. The garden of Eden. Greek gods.
  <em>The world that you know is ending.</em> I did not really believe this
  being to be telling the truth, but even if I wanted to I could not believe it,
  or even imagine it. I thought for a second of Cassie. At home, pulling bread
  from the oven; waiting for me to return from the store. I made this thought
  dissolve, and forced myself to resurface from my mind and meet the eye of the
  interface again. It could sense my puzzlement.
</p>
<p id="038adaff-da73-489c-9858-4fc709d417c9" class="">
  "I can try to explain further. That is my purpose for being here, talking to
  you, after all. Are you familiar with the concept of fermentation?"
</p>
<p id="a7d10627-057d-4d57-8882-dea2e208503f" class="">"Like, in winemaking?"</p>
<p id="555da312-30ca-487e-8217-36e07a126c0c" class="">
  "Or breadmaking, beermaking, yoghurtmaking. You humans use it quite adeptly.
  But yes, you have the right idea. Essentially, using a microbial culture to
  make food more digestible, or desirable in some other way.”
</p>
<p id="1145dd9a-3f47-4104-b348-a20616c21253" class="">
  “I guess so.” I answered.
</p>
<p id="d96739f6-3fac-4738-b760-816202509364" class="">
  ”The gods that created me ferment their food also."
</p>
<p id="a63900d8-03bc-409c-bc38-c3f1e0e4a891" class="">
  This branch of conversation felt like a detour. I was still hung up on that
  "end of the world" thing. I forced myself to focus on what the interface was
  saying. Fermentation. I imagined grape juice, and little microbes consuming
  sugar and excreting alcohol. Desirable, indeed. I focused real hard on the
  interface, squinting my eyes. This thing. Could it be alien technology? I had
  ruled out man-in-a-suit theory; but can I really believe what I am hearing
  right now? I thought of bread. Flour, water, starter. Cassie keeps the starter
  in the fridge. Dough rising on the counter, then baking in the oven. The
  delicious smell. That stupid, placid stony face staring blankly in my
  direction. What kind of sick practical joke... they must have hit me in the
  back of the head, my kidnappers. That's why I think I teleported. They hit me
  from behind on the head so now I can't remember anything. They placed me here,
  standing up. Standing up? I looked behind me, half expecting another, maybe
  bigger, Easter Island man to be there blocking some steel door. I couldn't
  make out anything that hinted at an exit. The walls were just as bare and
  smooth, betraying nothing.
</p>
<p id="a6239bce-f226-4d8a-870c-a9ffa0366a12" class="">
  I turned back around to face it. I wanted to cry out for help. Instead I did
  something much more irrational. I lunged forward at the figure. I don't know
  why. Call it flight or fight; call it hotheadedness. I lunged at the grey man.
  I had half expected to bounce off its solid looking body like it was truly
  stone statue, and braced for the impact. Instead, I absolutely tanked it;
  bringing us both to the floor. The figure had buckled under my amateurish
  tackle, showing no signs of resistance at all. On the ground I scrambled up
  its body towards its neck and placed my forearm firmly under its stupid Easter
  Island chin. The skin of this humanoid was cool and surprisingly soft. I dug
  in with my body weight.
</p>
<p id="d2369134-e7f6-4b21-883e-fd308caa24c4" class="">
  "Don't move!" I grunted. It showed no intention of trying. "I'll break your
  neck like a twig if you move. Do exactly what I say." The interface again
  showed no signs of trying to disobey me, and I felt my initial burst of
  aggression falter a little. "Tell your masters, or whoever is waiting for us
  outside this room, to come in here. If they don't, I'll kill you. I want to
  talk to them."
</p>
<p id="ecab6461-19f4-4f13-8c3d-a58f1c86f888" class="">
  "You can kill me. You'd only be cutting out your own ears." It said. This was
  intoned like a mother warning her well-intentioned but naive child against a
  foolish action. Though I was choking it, I could not hear strain in its voice.
</p>
<p id="4317dd41-d306-4885-9bdb-3df5ad61257c" class="">"What?"</p>
<p id="ec6ea3b0-6da3-40a8-abe1-c82f0df06145" class="">
  "This process does not require your knowledge of it to be successful. I exist
  here only for your benefit. You could kill me, and remain ignorant."
</p>
<p id="967d60ae-3327-48d2-922a-d3417acc3e7a" class="">
  "Why are you here at all then?"
</p>
<p id="5bdadf46-0dd0-4467-af53-7f853e2bbf6d" class="">
  “My creators would like for you to know what is happening to you. Not

  We lay there, suspended partway through a bad action sequence; me on top,
  pinning the interface down, my forearm dug into its neck. I could not feel a
  seam there, or the bottom of a mask. I rolled off the limp figure, panting. It
  remained where it was on the ground. We lay there in silence for a minute.
</p>
<p id="9e72911d-84a4-4b05-a101-b9213a6eacdd" class="">

  The interface turned its head to look at me. We lay there in parallel,
  regarding each other. Suddenly I had the impression that we looked like
  post-coital lovers. This image bubbled up in my frayed consciousness with a
  comedic timing that forced me to let out a haggard laugh.
</p>
<p id="6407aa57-6f52-4f09-b9eb-a95894f972a5" class="">

  “We were discussing fermented foods; something that your species makes use of

<p id="f510906a-bfb6-49ff-82cb-962e683b2854" class="">
  “Well, the gods that I have told you about. They also use a fermentation
  process to make food to their liking. These creatures, my masters, they are
  world-eaters. I mean this in the most literal sense. They devour planets to
  absorb energy. However, they will not eat worlds “raw”. They like for them to
  be… processed. Your species, humanity, acts like the bacterial culture. You
  see, your species can be relied upon to pre-digest the energy sources that the
  gods rely on: petroleum. This matter is distasteful to the gods in their raw
  form. Humans extract and convert it into palatable polymers, what you call
  <em>plastics”.</em>
</p>
<p id="32c18ea3-8afe-4dbc-9c07-d3a6d2a5fb64" class="">
  I wasn’t able to immediately understand. My physical systems had again begun
  to signal panic. The rising feeling in my chest distracted me for a moment.
  <em>Plastics.</em> What the hell? I didn’t get it. These creatures eat entire
  planets for plastics? This isn’t real. This isn’t happening. I dissolved. My
  mind completely emptied itself and the room went fuzzy. When I refocused on my
  surroundings, the interface had not moved. It appeared frozen in its mock
  lover’s sprawl; this image was grotesque to me now.

  polymer material, given enough time. Now that your planet, Earth as you call
  it, has become saturated with plastics, it is ready for consumption. You have
  been taken along with a sample of other humans to seed a new planet. Your
  batch will act as the starter to develop a new culture, in the microbiological
  sense of the word. To prepare this new world. In this way, the process repeats
  itself.”

  My head spun. I thought again of Cassie, then of my parents. Friends. I felt a
  twinge of desperation. I closed my eyes. Then thinking of them became
  physically impossible, and I began inexplicably to think of the woman who had
  sold me my groceries only an hour or so ago, as best I could tell. A
  middle-aged woman, grey cropped hair, plump, and all cheerfulness. Clocking
  out of her shift at Valu-mart. Taking off her apron. Getting into her car.
  Turning the ignition. I could see her, clear in my mind’s eye. Then,
  inexplicably, I saw a little boy sitting at a kitchen table, watching while
  his mother poured orange juice into his cup. Then I saw a fisherman in an old
  boat, watching the water on a misty still morning. A pharoah of Egypt watching
  his slaves construct a pyramid. A woman working a loom in a sweatshop in
  India. Tribes at war. The painting of the Sistine Chapel. Jesus on the cross.
  A child swimming through a trash-filled canal in a Nigerian slum. A million
  more images flashed in my mind. A plastic injection mould opening up to reveal
  a red toy shovel. A plastic bag floating in the ocean. A doctor discarding a
  medical mask. I felt the weight of it; the sheer and infinite volume of human
  experience, crushing me all at once. Nobody to remember. Existing for no
  purpose except to create plastic. Fermented oil. How could this be?
</p>
<p id="b28578da-6013-48a6-b047-46fc48732b1f" class="">
  “How can this be?” I stuttered.

<p id="43f63ffc-6932-4dc6-bad4-7d76601999d6" class="">
  “I understand this revelation is traumatic”, my interface replied. “But you
  must consider that to these creatures, you are like insects. Your
  consciousness is only a theoretical idea, and they do not feel empathy for
  you. Your relative simplicity assures them that there is no great loss in your
  destruction. The universe will not miss your science, your math, or your art.
  Your discoveries are only rudimentary, and you are considered to be quite
  inanimate by these beings I have called gods. This conversation, my disclosure

  “Yes. I mentioned it as the reason why you and I are here. My existence is for

  that if a culture of humans can preserve the knowledge you are now being
  given, over the span of a whole civilization, and avoid fulfilling their role

  purposes.”

  The Easter island head looked at me placidly. I stared back into the stony
  face; the absence of eyes under its protruding brow; the long abstract nose
  with no nostrils. The face that looked so much like the statues I had seen in
  pictures from a dead civilization. I now realized with a reeling horror that
  It was no coincidence. This being was not created in the likeness of those
  heads. This was the original. The Easter island statues were imitations.
  Unheard warnings. My throat tightened, and my stomach dropped. I gasped for
  air, and could speak no further. It didn’t matter; our conversation was done.

  “I have fulfilled my duty to you, human. Go forth, and multiply. Your
  descendants will meet me again one day. Goodbye.”

  I stared blankly at the statue. It made no further sounds. And then everything
  disappeared again; the statue, the walls of the room disappeared like a movie
  cut. Now I was floating in space. I could see the stars, the milky way, the
  moon. And right there in the centre of my vision was earth. Our blue and white
  ball. I felt cold, but my body was sweating intensely. I hung there, suspended
  like an insect in a spider’s web. Then, as I watched, a shadow began to pass
  over the earth. From left to right, a black mass covered the continents, and I
  realized that it was being engulfed by something magnificent. In a few seconds
  it was gone. The shadow moved on, blotting out stars as it went, and I could
  see the stars that had been hidden behind Earth. No sign was left of my home
  planet. I stared there, where it had been, for a minute. My eyes fixed on the
  spot where my life and the life of everyone I knew had been lived.

  Then, as I floated there, an enormous shape ascended into my field of vision
  from below. It appeared to me to be larger than the planet that had just been
  there, engulfing my entire field of vision. It was a collection of concentric
  rings, spinning around an invisible centre, creating the impression of a
  massive orb. On each ring I could see millions of eyes, like the eyes of a
  spider, all seemingly fixed on me. In the centre of the rings I could see only
  a bright white light that blinded me. It hovered there, and seemed to ponder
  me. I was empty, and could only look back at it with hollow eyes.

  Then the scene changed again. I was back on solid ground. I realized I was
  kneeling. I looked around. I was in a field, with trees lining its edges.
  Above me the sky shone with the hue of dawn. I looked up and saw two crescent
  moons, one slightly above the other, hanging pale and low. I looked back down
  and realized there was another figure in the field, about two hundred feet
  from me. I forced my blurry vision to focus, and saw that it was a woman. She
  was kneeling also. From where I was, I could not see her face. She was hunched
  over, but I could see that her body was convulsing in dramatic shudders. She
  was weeping. I began to cry too.
