<p class="first-paragraph">
  Montreal, Quebec is the second largest city in Canada after Toronto, and only
  about 5 hours away by car. Until last week, I had never been there. I am much
  more familiar with Toronto, having grown up nearby in Hamilton. I now live in
  Waterloo, Ontario, also close to Toronto – about 100km to the West. Toronto,
  Hamilton and Waterloo actually share a lot of similarities in their built
  forms (at different scales) that are recognizable across a lot of North
  America. They are dominated by detached homes, often set back from the road by
  lawns. Multi-family housing is generally confined to the downtown, and mainly
  comes in the form of high-rise towers. Toronto is a large city, but I am
  always amazed at how <em>suburban</em> the metropolis is. Sure, the downtown
  core is stocked with very, <em>very</em> tall skyscrapers. But venture just a
  little bit outwards and you’re more likely to find single-family detached
  homes than anything else. Take a look at this Google streetview photo:

    these homes are duplexes; many of them are not.

<p>
  This street is a two minute’s walk to a subway station on the Bloor street
  line. The entire neighbourhood surrounding this station (and many other
  Toronto subway stations) is essentially suburban in form. You can imagine that
  many people would like to live close to a subway line in Toronto, but our
  zoning laws ensure that only relatively few can. I don’t want to spend too
  much time pointing out the flaws in Toronto’s urban design, but I think this
  kind of underuse of infrastructure – underuse which is frozen in place by our
  zoning code – emphasizes how the fetish for suburban homes has a cultural
  stranglehold on us in English Canada.

<h1>The built environment of Montreal</h1>
<p>
  Now, on to Montreal. My partner and I recently spent a week in Montreal for no
  particular reason except to visit some friends and see the city. She was
  working remotely, but I had the week off and plenty of time to explore. I
  chose cycling as my preferred way to get around, which was nice because it
  allowed me to cover a larger geographical area rather than being restricted to
  where I could walk from the neighbourhood we were staying in. I was really
  amazed, biking around, at the frequency at which my “missing middle” alarm
  bells rang.

  So much of Montreal looks like the middle of this infographic. Lots of it
  looks like the right end of the density gradient, and some of it looks like
  the left end. Here are some photos I took while biking around:

<p>
  These photos are mostly from the more downtown areas of Montreal, but I
  ventured further out into the suburbs as well and found lots of similar
  development, albeit with more car infrastructure. Wider roads gave the
  neighbourhoods less of an intimate, urban feel, but it was still quite
  <em>different</em> compared to suburbs in the Greater Toronto Area.

  As I explored, I became convinced that “missing middle” housing is the default
  in Montreal. This is true whether the neighbourhood is old or new, suburban or
  urban. Sure, I also saw single family detached homes:

  But in general these were the exception, not the rule. I wanted to see whether
  my impression matched reality. Thanks to
  <a href="https://censusmapper.ca/">https://censusmapper.ca</a> I was able to
  look at the predominant housing forms in Montreal and Toronto using Canadian
  census data. The following images show Montreal and Toronto from the same
  scale, coloured by the predominant housing type in each census area as of the
  2016 census. Red areas feature predominantly single family detached homes (the
  legend mistakenly includes duplexes), the blue areas are predominantly
  duplexes, rowhouses, and lowrise apartments, and the green areas are
  predominantly highrises.

  You can see that Toronto is more of a mixed bag than Montreal. The older,
  historic part of the city features lots of blue. The downtown is visible along
  lake Ontario as solid green, and the newer, more far flung parts of the city
  are a splotchy patchwork of red and green, with little missing middle.
  Montreal at the same scale is almost solid blue, with isolated patches of red
  and a few green areas. You can explore the maps yourself,
  <a href="https://censusmapper.ca/maps/718#12/45.5278/-73.6319">here</a>
  (Montreal) and
  <a href="https://censusmapper.ca/maps/718#12/43.7202/-79.4224">here</a>
  (Toronto). I also mapped both cities according to population density per
  square kilometre using 2021 Canadian census data:

<p>
  The results are a little less obvious here. Both cities have large areas of
  low population density. I will admit that I did not venture off Montreal
  island into the surrounding communities. Still, the central part of Montreal
  has a larger area of purple hues (higher-density) compared to central Toronto.
  Montreal island is more consistently purplish, whereas Toronto's purple areas
  are restricted to the historic part of the city, and transit corridors.

<h1>Is Montreal Affordable?</h1>
<p>
  One thing that always comes up in conversations with friends about Montreal is
  its affordability. Montreal has cheaper rent than other Canadian cities which
  are notoriously expensive – Toronto and Vancouver – but also mid-sized
  Canadian cities. Below are maps of Montreal and Toronto, using Canadian 2021
  census data, of Median monthly shelter costs for rented dwellings in Canadian
  dollars.

  Montrealers clearly spend much less on rent than Torontonians. Here's the same

  Keep in mind Waterloo is a city of less than 115,000 people! Comparing home
  prices is a little harder, apples-to-apples, because of the different housing
  types predominant in Montreal vs. other cities, but
  <a href="https://blog.remax.ca/kitchener-waterloo-housing-market-outlook/"

  claims that Waterloo single-family homes averaged over $900,000 as of March
  2022, and the

  wrote in May of 2022 that single-family homes in Montreal averaged $576,000.
  <a href="https://wowa.ca/toronto-housing-market">Wowza</a> claims that
  single-family homes in Toronto averaged $1.38M in August 2022, a
  year-over-year <em>decrease</em>. This tracks to my subjective experience. I
  chatted with someone around my age who mentioned that they had recently
  purchased a home in Montreal for $300K. Finding a home at this price would be
  a miracle in Waterloo these days!

<h1>Why land use matters</h1>
<p>
  When I talked to Montrealers about housing costs, they were quick to point out
  that it is not as cheap to live there as it once was, but agreed that it is
  still cheap compared to other Canadian cities. When I asked them why they
  thought Montreal has a better housing market, they mentioned that the French
  language has acted as a barrier to the economy, in turn limiting population
  growth. This was more true before the COVID-19 pandemic and the remote-work
  economy; however most jobs based in Quebec require one to speak French, so it
  seems plausible still. Yet I think this only tells part of the story.
  Montreal’s population <em>has</em> been growing, if not quite as fast as
  Toronto’s:

  These growth charts look fairly similar (though note that the y-axis' are not
  exactly the same). I believe that the way Montreal builds housing is the main
  cause of its relative affordability. But affordability aside, letting more
  people live in urban areas where they can be close to where they work, close
  to grocery stores, etc. just seems <em>good</em>. Doesn’t this:

  Don’t get me wrong, I think highrise condos and single family detached homes
  have their place. Lots of people want a large home with a lawn. But more than
  anything people want an affordable place to live, close to their work, their
  family, friends, etc. There's a reason the realtor's motto is
  <em>location, location, location</em>. It would be nice if detached homes and
  condo towers weren’t essentially the only two housing options in most of North
  America. It would be nice if more people could live where they want to live. I
  imagine that if people were given the option to live in the kinds of
  communities that I found in Montreal, many – not all, of course! – would.

  I didn’t come to Montreal as a blank slate. I had already formed opinions on
  the merits of mixed-use, walkable neighbourhoods, density, etc before my
  visit. But seeing this pattern of development in the real world, experiencing
  how nice it is, how functional and how affordable, was vindicating. Above all,
  it showed me that beautiful, lively neighbourhoods don’t have to be for rich
  people only. I think that people tend to associate walkable, treed
  neighbourhoods with high rents. In North America, they are usually right. What
  I saw in Montreal, whether this was <em>caused</em> by the development pattern
  or not, is that all kinds of people can and do live in these sorts of
  neighbourhoods. I would love for that to be true for other cities too.
</p>
<h1>PS, a quick note on transit</h1>
<p>
  This article isn't really about transit, and what I'm about to say here has
  been expressed in better detail many other places. But another thing that I
  loved about Montreal was how easy it was for me to walk, bike, or take transit
  to where I needed to go. Montreal has some of the best bike infrastructure in
  Canada, and this was a large part of the comfort I felt cycling around there,
  but in my opinion there is another, more important factor. This may sound
  obvious, but cycling in Montreal is so good because places you want to go are
  generally
  <em>within biking distance</em>. The larger the footprint of a city is, the
  longer it will take to get around; but a travel distance that is slightly more
  inconvenient in a car might be prohibitive on a bicycle. This is doubly true
  for walking, and even transit is worse where density is lower, because
  connections and stops add up and can make trips significantly longer.
