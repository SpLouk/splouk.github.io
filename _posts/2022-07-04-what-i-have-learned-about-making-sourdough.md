<p>
  I began making sourdough in February of this year. At first, I tried to
  loosely follow some Youtube guides that I came across, but I found that the
  results were inconsistent and often inedible. This is how some of the early
  loaves I made looked:

  There were more loaves that were somewhere between the two above in terms of
  quality. Now, making a loaf of sourdough bread is typically a full day’s
  effort (I’ve figured out ways to make the process more flexible for a busy
  schedule, which I’ll discuss more later), so getting a mediocre result after a
  full day’s work is pretty discouraging, never mind when the whole loaf needs
  to be tossed! This would not do, so I decided to get serious about making
  sourdough.

    I downloaded an e-book copy of
    <a href="https://www.google.ca/books/edition/Tartine_Bread/JS_UAAAAQBAJ"
      >Tartine Bread</a
    >
    by Chad Robertson, which contains a step-by-step recipe for what he calls
    “the country loaf”, i.e. a basic sourdough. Following this guide closely
    transformed my results instantly; now I was consistently getting light,
    fluffy, moist, delicious sourdough bread. I will take the chance to brag a
    bit here and say that I now prefer my own bread to almost any that I have
    bought in a bakery. Since I began using this book to bake bread, I have
    learned a couple of things about making sourdough through experimentation
    and note-taking. I will talk about some of these findings, but first I would
    like to elaborate on my note-taking process, and how it has helped me.

  Make bread; take notes; make break again, reviewing your notes from last time,
  take notes again; repeat. The first variable that I started playing around
  with once I was consistently producing edible loaves is
  <em>hydration</em>. Hydration refers to the water that a loaf contains, by
  weight, as a percentage of the weight of the flour used. For example, if I
  used 1000g of flour and 800g water, then I have an 80% hydration loaf. I had
  read that higher hydration loaves are a mark of artisanal bread, because
  working wet dough is challenging. When I started to boost my hydration to 80,
  85, then 90%, I found that I loved the moist, spongy result. However, I also
  began to find that my loaves did not have the same “oven spring” (rise) and
  instead tended to be flatter and wider, losing their structure in the baking
  process. After doing some googling, I found out that higher-hydration loaves
  will not rise as much. Looking back through my notes, I was able to see the
  progression of how my loaves rose less the more hydration I used. I’ve now
  settled in the 75%-80% range, and am back to getting nicely structured loaves.

  The other tool that has allowed me to get consistently good bread is the
  humble checklist. I have learned to
  <strong
    >use checklists for jobs that follow a process, even if you don’t think you
    need to</strong
  >. Checklists simply guard against forgetfulness, something I am often victim
  to. I use the same checklist for each loaf I make (I use a
  <a href="https://notion.so">Notion.so</a> template for my bread notes, so the
  checklist is right there at the top always). Before I started using
  checklists, I forgot to add salt to one of my loaves, and burned another by
  using the wrong oven temperature. These kinds of mistakes haven’t happened
  since I adopted the checklist.
</p>
<p>
  I still mostly follow the Tartine country bread recipe, which makes two loaves
  at a time. Instead of baking the loaves serially, I bake both at once because
  I happen to have two dutch ovens. Another modification I have made is that I
  leave the dough in the same container for the entirety of the fermentation
  process, which saves me a dish. Some key things I really like about the
  Tartine process:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    stretch-and-folding the dough inside its container during the fermentation
    process saves a ton of mess and hassle, compared to dumping it on the
    counter to knead
  </li>
  <li>
    making two loaves at once makes the whole process feel a lot more worthwhile
  </li>
  <li>it’s a very simple recipe that makes great bread</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The Tartine bread process is actually not a ton of work. From start to finish,
  it’s probably an hour or so of actual hands-on time. However, that labour is
  spread out over a ~24 hour period. The typical breadmaking schedule I have
  followed is something like this:
</p>
<p>12:00PM day 1 - mix flour/water/starter</p>
<p>
  12:45PM - add salt, ferment all afternoon; stretch-and-fold ever half-hour or
  so
</p>
<p>5PM - shape loaves</p>
<p>6PM - begin final proofing in fridge</p>
<p>8AM day 2 - bake</p>
<p>
  So while there isn’t a ton of actual labour, this is still a time-consuming
  process. In the days of WFH it was kind of nice to get up from my computer
  every half-hour to turn dough, but once I started working in the office again
  this wasn’t possible. Sourdough making became a weekend-only activity.
</p>
<p>
  Looking to make the process more flexible, I began experimenting with doing
  the fermentation step in the fridge. The idea behind this is to stretch the
  fermentation out from taking ~4 hours at 25degC to taking a day or two in the
  fridge. Then, if I want to make a loaf, I can start it if I have an hour free
  on a weeknight, set it in the fridge to ferment, and shape it the next evening
  or the evening after. All I have to do is stretch-and-fold it every so often
  when I’m already in the kitchen. This has worked out pretty well so far. The
  longer fermentation results in more complex (and slightly sourer) bread
  flavours, but the effect is small and I actually like the taste better. A
  “fridge rise” schedule might look like this:
</p>
<p>6PM day 1 - mix flour/water/starter</p>
<p>6:45PM - add salt; place in fridge for fermentation</p>
<p>day 2 - stretch and fold as convenient</p>
<p>6PM day 3 - shape loaves</p>
<p>7PM day 3 - begin final proofing in fridge</p>
<p>8AM day 4 - bake</p>
<p>
  The time between adding salt and shaping the loaves is fairly flexible, and
  could probably be between 1-2.5 days (I haven’t experimented enough with this
  method yet to know an exact range), meaning that this method can easily be
  integrated with a busy schedule.
</p>
<p>
  My last learning so far:
  <strong>making your own bread is 100% worth it.</strong> Honestly, while I
  like the process, the majority of the reason why I have kept up consistently
  making bread is just how delicious the result is. Plastic-bag bread is ruined
  for me forever, and I don’t live very close to a good bakery. I’m trapped in a
  vicious cycle of baking and eating delicious bread and I can’t get out!
