<p class="first-paragraph">
  Seeing like a State by James C. Scott is an exploration of the ways that
  governments have shaped the world to their ends over the past few hundred
  years. The enlightenment created a new faith in
  <em>science</em>, and the use of the scientific method to understand and
  dramatically reshape society and culture. Scott ambitiously groups together
  many separate social phenomena, as disparate as the creation of standardized
  units of measurement, the adoption of permanent surnames, the central planning
  of economies, scientific agriculture, and modern city planning, into a
  coherent process of centralization and standardization undertaken by states,
  calling the philosophy underlying all of these developments
  <em>high modernism.</em> <em>High modernism</em> is essentially the belief
  that “traditional” forms of knowledge and ways of doing things are backwards
  and outdated, and that the application of central planning by trained experts
  using <em>science</em> ought to replace these traditional ways. In the case of
  standardizing measurements, this looks like replacing local, colloquial
  measurements, which are based on the industries that use them and vary greatly
  from region to region, with standards like metres, kilograms, etc. In the case
  of city planning, this means replacing ancient, dense, unplanned cities with
  centrally planned grid cities zoned to create order and regularity. The book
  is generally a critique of high modernism, and especially the application of
  this philosophy in authoritarian settings like communist states and European
  colonies.

    For example, the expansion of “modern” agriculture – monocropped, huge-scale
    industrial farms – in the “third world” by Western nations in colonial and
    non-colonial settings. He makes it clear that this was often done with
    ostensibly good intentions, in the name of development and modernization.
    Yet, often these schemes were spectacular failures, sometimes with fatal
    results for the local people on whom these schemes were forced. Scott
    documents how Western scientists and governments had little regard for the
    applied knowledge (he resists the term “traditional knowledge”, since it
    implies a dogmatic and ignorant practice) of the local populations, even
    though it usually turned out that their practices had strong effectiveness
    in the local contexts to which they were adapted. An indigenous farmer in
    South America might farm in a polyculture, planting many crops and several
    varieties of the same crop (corn, sweet potatoes, rice, etc.) in one plot.
    These messy looking farms appeared disorderly and inefficient to Western
    people, who tried to get them to plant monocultures in neat, orderly rows;
    but it turns out that this preference for visual order was not exactly
    scientifically based and more of an aesthetic preference. Monocultures are
    more vulnerable to disease and pests, and require fertilizer to make up for
    their depletion of natural soil fertility. An indigenous farmer’s strategy
    might balance several objectives at once, like preventing erosion,
    resilience against pests and disease, and providing complete nutrition for
    his family, but these objectives were unseen by Western rationality, which
    prized total yield above everything else.

  I enjoyed reading about each of the examples of “high modernism” explored in
  this book, and I think the extrapolation is convincing, personally. Grand
  schemes which ignore local context and attempt to make complex systems
  “legible” are dangerous and often blow up in one’s face. I think I was already
  primed to agree with this from reading
  <em>Antifragile</em> by Nassim Taleb, another book that talks extensively
  about complex systems and our failure to control or simplify them. That, and
  my experience with Jane Jacobs (<em
    >Life and Death of Great American Cities</em
  >) and the blog <a href="http://strongtowns.org">strongtowns.org</a> meant
  that the chapter on city planning was mostly review for me, though I always
  like having my prior opinions validated!

  this book is a frame shifter, encouraging readers to respect complex, emergent
  phenomena and the order hidden in them. Cities, natural ecosystems, and
  languages are all examples here. A city is more related to a forest than it is
  to say, a car, because cities are emergent (i.e. “natural”) whereas as car is
  engineered, top-down, and complicated but not complex. We still make the
  mistake, I think, of trying to engineer complex systems, and wrangle them into
  predictability and stability. If anything, this book implores us to exercise
  some humility when considering a new mega-project to completely reinvent some
  domain of human activity. In the conclusion to the book, Scott proposes a few
  rules of thumb to guide decision making to avoid repeating the mistakes of
  high modernism:
  <em>take small steps, favour reversibility, plan on surprises,</em> and
  <em>plan on human inventiveness.</em>
</p>

  Through the entire book, Scott often qualifies his claims, acknowledging that
  there are probably many domains where top-down, hierarchical systems work
  well, where grand schemes work well, where extensive planning works well; he
  points to examples like healthcare planning and transportation networks. Scale
  matters; while a city should not be centrally planned, a single apartment
  probably should be; while a country probably shouldn’t spend billions of
  dollars building huge, mechanized farms, spending billions of dollars on a
  robust high-speed rail network is more likely to be a good investment. Once I
  began to think in terms of spontaneous order vs. centralized engineering, I
  started to see examples of it everywhere. I think it even exists at the
  personal level; some people organize themselves according to adaptability and
  incrementalism, and others are more given to long-term goal setting and
  attempting to plan and control their environment. Observing the world in terms
  of this dichotomy might be useful to learn when each strategy is appropriate
  in one’s own life.

<p>I highly recommend this book.</p>
