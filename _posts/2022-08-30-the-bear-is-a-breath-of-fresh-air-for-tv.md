  It was after watching two seasons of Succession that I finally realized it is
  a show where each and every character is evil and incapable of change. At
  first I rooted for Shiv. She seemed reasonable in those first couple of
  episodes! Then Gerri, Kendall, then even Roman for a bit. The show settled
  into a kind of rotation where each of the siblings has their turn to display a
  glimmer of likeability. The audience grasps onto these moments like a life
  raft; anything to avoid drowning in the cynicism! But then, gotcha! It was a
  ruse; the life raft is actually a lure, and you’re caught and pulled further
  down into the dark world of the Roys. This gridlock became frustrating after a
  while. I continued to watch Succession loyally of course, unable to abandon
  such an otherwise well-written show; but I wisened up and accepted that each
  of these characters is rotten to their scheming, power hungry cores; they will
  never see the light.

  The Bear is a show about a kitchen and the staff who work in it. Carmy (Jeremy
  Allen White), gives up his career at a prestigious NYC restaurant after his
  brother dies suddenly and leaves the failing family restaurant to him. He
  returns to his hometown Chicago and tries to improve the restaurant while
  navigating financial insolvency and the employees who come with the place,
  some of whom are hostile to change.

    The show feels very much like a product of the current moment. Mental health
    features prominently in the plot, with each main character getting time to
    show their struggles with anxiety, PTSD, and depression. The show is about
    cooking; and yes, they talk about salt, fat and acid. There is even a line
    about COVID-19 that doesn’t feel completely stilted, the first successful
    attempt I’ve seen in a show or movie since the pandemic. One thing that this
    show does not have, which sets it apart from a lot of the prestige TV made
    in the last ten years, is cynicism. Game of Thrones convinced us that human
    relationships are primarily about power, and shows haven’t given up that
    framing since. In the 2010s TV and movies followed the mantra of
    <em>dark is realistic</em>; if a show was to be taken seriously, to be seen
    as art, it could not be anything less than <em>grim.</em> House of Cards,
    Veep, Succession and more all contributed to this general malaise. While it
    might have been edgy and exciting at first, this outlook has become worn-in
    and tired.

  The Bear is not light. It’s stressful; it allows for suffering and features
  characters in various states of mental unwell. But it is not cynical. People
  work together. They attempt (not always successfully) to support each other.
  Characters that are initially positioned as villains, Richie (Ebon
  Moss-Bachrach) and Tina (Liza Colón-Zayas), display nuance early in the first
  season. Actually, the writers were a bit too eager to show us that there are
  no true villains at The Original Beef of Chicagoland. Richie gets his moment
  in episode two. He is a pain in the ass the whole episode, and while
  misogynistically degrading Sydney (Ayo Edebiri) – who is the only person
  trying to help him at this point – he receives a phone call in which he
  comforts his daughter who is having a bad day at school. The scene was
  hamfisted in my opinion; a little too obvious of a play. The other difficult
  character, Tina, gets the same treatment two episodes later. She changes from
  being completely antagonistic towards Carmy’s initiative to run the kitchen as
  a
  <em>brigade de cuisine</em> (particularly aiming her ire at the new sous-chef
  Sydney), to warming up to the new regime and treating Sydney with tenderness
  in the space of one episode. Watching it happen so quickly felt forced and I
  can’t help but feel that people don’t usually operate like this; that subplot
  could have marinated for another episode or two.

    As the season progresses the show settles into its pacing. Each character is
    given time and development. The back-half of the season is absolutely
    masterful. Episode 6 begins with Jon Bernthal as Carmy’s deceased brother
    Mikey (yes, every character’s name ends with an -ey sound) in an engaging
    flashback sequence that gives us so much insight into his character in very
    little screen time. Mikey tells a captivating story of a night out in
    Chicago that ends at a bar at 6AM with Bill Murray. His audience, Richie,
    Carmy and Sugar (Carmy’s sister, played by Abby Elliott) are engaged; they
    laugh at the right times and contribute their quips as sunlight spills into
    the kitchen. They are all preparing food together. The scene then cuts
    directly to Richie telling this same story in the present day to a date in a
    dark restaurant, but the magic of the story is completely lost on her. The
    contrast in these two scenes is so well done and works on multiple levels:
    Richie’s relative lack of charisma compared to Mikey, but also his date’s
    recoiling at the story reflects a class gap between them; or is it temporal?
    Richie stands in for “old Chicago” often in this show; in fact, he sees his
    own role in the restaurant as being vanguard of a threatened and vanishing
    “working class”, his anachronism is self-aware.

  Episode seven is absolutely masterful. I won’t say much about it here because
  it speaks for itself, but the 20-minute episode acts as a perfect climax to
  season 1. The season ends on a high note tonally in episode 8 as Carmy
  discovers that his deceased brother has been squirrelling away borrowed money
  in tomato cans, paying an aluminium company to seal wads of cash inside. This
  ending, though foreshadowed cleverly throughout the season, is a confusing
  <em>deus ex machina</em> that I can only hope is justified better in season 2.

  The show has set itself up ambitiously with a cast and storyline that each
  feel like they have plenty of depth to explore. But I can also imagine a
  possible path this show could take where it ends up becoming popular but
  sitcom-adjacent. You might think this would be impossible for a show that so
  regularly depicts chaotic and stressful kitchen scenes, but it’s 2022 and that
  spiciness might be perfect for a new era of sitcom. Audiences might even come
  to expect these scenes as a comforting staple of the show, like Jim Halpert’s
  pranks in The Office. The way that the more antagonistic characters were
  quickly domesticated in season 1 leaves us with no real villains on the show,
  and the perplexing ending of season 1 seemingly resolves the financial
  stresses that provided so much of that season’s drama. This is fine, but I
  would not like to see The Bear become Ted Lasso with yelling. To stay
  interesting, shows need to have real conflict and tension. I am curious to see
  what avenues the writers choose to explore in season 2. Overall, this is my
  favourite new show in a long time. It feels
  <em>different</em>: smart, complex, but not needlessly dark. A breath of fresh
  air for television.

<p style="margin: 0">Stray observations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Natalie (Sugar) spends most of her screentime whining. I hope this dynamic
      improves in season 2
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The supporting cast is awesome. More of Marcus please!</p>

      I just don't find Matty Matheson funny! His scenes were a waste of time,
      IMO.

      People liked Richie's "4chan, Qanon, Snyder cut motherfuckers" line. All I
      could hear was the writing room. Richie probably wouldn't know what any of
      those things are! (except maybe qanon). The writing in the pilot was kind
      of clumsy overall.

      People have said they don't like the way Sydney talks – that she's too
      indirect and meandering. I love it.
