# Thai pie recipe

Thai pie is essentially Québécois tourtière pie with Thai aromatics. I came up with the idea because I wanted to make tourtière pie but did not have all of the spices required by [this recipe](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/261983/tourtiere-french-canadian-meat-pie/), but I did happen to have lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves that needed using up. Here is how to make it.

## Ingredients

- Pie crust (I use Tenderflake pie crusts, which are made with simple ingredients and work quite well. You can make your own if you wish)
- 1 tablespoon of coconut oil or neutral cooking oil
- 1 large onion, finely diced
- 4 cloves of minced garlic
- 1 pound of ground pork
- 1 pound of ground beef
- 1 cup of light beer (optional)
- 1/2-1 cup bamboo shoots (I used “Shodoisland” boiled bamboo shoots)
